<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

Stock News Alert is a little project for retrieving stock news by calling an API of a news website. It was intended to
be a messenger ðŸšš (kinda) to deliver the news. The news was originally supposed to be sent by Twilio. But somehow they charge
money. I needed an alternative and got the idea to send the news to discord instead. You might use other messengers as 
wish. 

The code has nothing fancy. It shows an arrow up when the price is going up and a down arrow if the price goes down.
A headline, a couple of lines of the news, and the link to it will also be in the message.
